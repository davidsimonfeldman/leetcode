Medium

SQL Schema
Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about customers.
 

Table: Orders

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| customer_id   | int     |
| cost          | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
Each customer has one order per day.
 

Write an SQL query to find the most recent 3 orders of each user. If a user ordered less than 3 orders return all of their orders.

Return the result table sorted by customer_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the customer_id in ascending order. If there still a tie, order them by the order_date in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Customers
+-------------+-----------+
| customer_id | name      |
+-------------+-----------+
| 1           | Winston   |
| 2           | Jonathan  |
| 3           | Annabelle |
| 4           | Marwan    |
| 5           | Khaled    |
+-------------+-----------+

Orders
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | cost |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 30   |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 40   |
| 3        | 2020-07-31 | 3           | 70   |
| 4        | 2020-07-29 | 4           | 100  |
| 5        | 2020-06-10 | 1           | 1010 |
| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 102  |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 111  |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 99   |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 32   |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2    |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+

Result table:
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| customer_name | customer_id | order_id | order_date |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| Annabelle     | 3           | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| Annabelle     | 3           | 3        | 2020-07-31 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 9        | 2020-08-07 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 2        | 2020-07-30 |
| Marwan        | 4           | 4        | 2020-07-29 |
| Winston       | 1           | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| Winston       | 1           | 1        | 2020-07-31 |
| Winston       | 1           | 10       | 2020-07-15 |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
Winston has 4 orders, we discard the order of "2020-06-10" because it is the oldest order.
Annabelle has only 2 orders, we return them.
Jonathan has exactly 3 orders.
Marwan ordered only one time.
We sort the result table by customer_name in ascending order, by customer_id in ascending order and by order_date in descending order in case of a tie.
Follow-up:
Can you write a general solution for the most recent n orders?


select customer_name, customer_id, order_id, order_date
from
(select  name customer_name, c.customer_id, order_id, order_date,
rank() over(partition by c.customer_id order by order_date desc) rank
from customers c
inner join
orders o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id) temp
where rank <=3
order by customer_name, customer_id, order_date desc


# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT a.name as customer_name,a.customer_id,b.order_id,b.order_date
FROM Customers as a
JOIN Orders as b
ON a.customer_id=b.customer_id
JOIN Orders as c
ON b.customer_id=c.customer_id AND b.order_date<=c.order_date
GROUP BY customer_name,a.customer_id,b.order_id,b.order_date
HAVING COUNT(c.order_date)<=3
ORDER BY customer_name,customer_id,order_date DESC;







select name customer_name,d.[customer_id] ,d.[order_id] ,[order_date] from
(SELECT name,o.[customer_id] ,o.[order_id] ,[order_date]  ,
rank()over(partition by o.[customer_id] order by [order_date] desc) rn
  FROM Orders o
  join Customers c
  on o.[customer_id]=c.[customer_id]
 ) d
  where rn<4
 order by name asc, [customer_id] asc,[order_date] desc
